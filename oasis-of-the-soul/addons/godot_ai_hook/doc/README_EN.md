# Godot AI Hook

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

## Overview: Purpose & Benefits

**Godot AI Hook** is an AI chat plugin for **Godot 4.5**, designed to quickly integrate models that are **compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completions protocol**
(such as OpenAI-compatible APIs provided by cloud vendors).

If you want to easily bring large language models like **DeepSeek** or **Doubao** into your game, allowing:

* Protagonists and enemies to talk to each other
* NPCs to have their own “thoughts”
* Background text and narration to feel more vivid and dynamic

then this plugin works like an **AI hook** that can be attached directly to nodes — simple, intuitive, and Godot-native.

> **The goal of Godot AI Hook is:
> to turn AI into a Godot node you already understand,
> rather than an external SDK.**

* **Node-first**: AI is a node that can be attached and called directly
* **Unified API**: Streaming and non-streaming share the same entry points
* **Client-side**: No hard binding to models or vendors
* **Defensive**: Fail explicitly, no hidden “magic”


---

## 🎮 Use Cases

Godot AI Hook is particularly well-suited for the following scenarios:

---

### 🧙 NPC Dialogue & Personality-Driven Behavior

* Each NPC can use a different System Prompt
* Dialogue content is generated dynamically
* NPCs are no longer limited to static option trees

---

### 📜 Story Narration & Worldbuilding Text

* Streaming output is ideal for:

  * Story subtitles
  * World lore descriptions
  * Memories and inner monologues

Combined with a typewriter effect, this can greatly enhance immersion.

---

### 🧪 Prototyping & Gameplay Experiments

During early prototyping, you can:

* Skip writing full story scripts
* Avoid complex dialogue trees
* Use AI to quickly validate gameplay feel

---

### 🤖 In-Game AI Assistants & Guide Characters

* Tutorial assistants
* System hint characters
* “Fourth-wall-breaking” explainers

---

### 🛠️ Informal Uses (Tools & Experiments)

Although it is a game plugin, it can also be used for:

* AI-powered tools inside Godot
* Text generation testing
* AI behavior experiments

## ✨ One-Sentence Design Summary

> **Godot AI Hook does not try to teach you how to use AI.
> It simply turns AI into a Godot node you already understand.**

> **Note**
> Most model providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs, and this plugin attempts to support them as much as possible.
> However, due to differences in request/response implementations, some models may not work correctly.

## Security Statement & Disclaimer

This project only implements **AI invocation logic** and is intended mainly for **personal learning, research, and experimental use**.
It is **not designed with comprehensive security or compliance guarantees**.

When using this plugin, please conduct your own risk assessment, including but not limited to:

* Keep API keys secure; never commit real keys to public repositories or expose them in screenshots
* Set reasonable request rates and quotas to avoid abuse or triggering provider limits
* Review and filter AI-generated output based on your application’s needs

This project is only a client-side wrapper for AI services and **does not take responsibility for generated content**.
Please use it in compliance with local laws and the terms of service of your model providers.

### Core Script Responsibilities

#### AiManage

* Main public interfaces:

  * `say(content, system_prompt)`
  * `say_bind_key(content, key)`
  * `set_ai_stream_type(is_true)`

---

#### ChatNode

* Sends a single request using `HTTPRequest`
* Parses the full JSON response
* Reports errors via `parent.on_ai_error_occurred()`

---

#### ChatStreamNode

* Establishes an HTTPS connection using `HTTPClient`
* Sends requests with `stream: true`
* Parses SSE text streams starting with `data:`
* Detects the `[DONE]` end marker
* Pushes incremental output via:

  * `on_ai_reasoning_content_generated`
  * `on_ai_content_generated`

---

#### Test Panel

* Provides a UI for quickly testing API connectivity and output behavior
* Includes logic for interrupting long-running text generation

---

## Usage

### 1. Install the Plugin

Copy the `godot_ai_hook` folder into your project’s `addons` directory.

Then enable the plugin via:

**Menu → Project → Project Settings → Plugins**

---

### 2. Configure Model Information

In **Menu → Project → Tools**, you will find **AI Hook** related options.

![show\_config](https://github.com/3301712806/godot_ai_hook/blob/main/image/config.jpg?raw=true)

Click **AI Hook: Open Model Config Script** and fill in the configuration according to your model provider’s documentation.

![config\_ai](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b94231e-50de-4797-a590-8fc0c7e21cbd)

---

### 3. Test Model Connectivity

Click **AI Hook: Open Test Panel**, then run the test scene.

![open\_test](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75117546-b25c-499d-8e0e-c2ef55a26846)

Successful connection example:

![test](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/431d6c29-2927-41fb-af11-f4c04cd686d2)

---

### 4. Use Godot AI Hook

Select a text node in your scene and attach an `ai_manage` node as its child
(search for `ai_manage` with `Ctrl + A`).

![load\_ai\_manage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e15d6fcd-dbd6-47ce-8ee7-6dead78bbfd0)

Reference the node in your script and call:

```gdscript
ai_manage.say("Your question here")
```

Run the scene to see the AI response.

![it\_work!](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbb93514-873c-429c-aa9f-309a4ef202af)

---

### 5. Use Custom System Prompts

Although you can pass a `system_prompt` directly:

```gdscript
ai_manage.say("Question content", system_prompt)
```

System Prompts are often long, so **using a config file with keys is recommended**.

Open **Menu → Project → Tools → AI Hook: Open System Prompt Config Script**:

![system\_prompt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba27dd85-aab4-4106-8282-54c9aca126ed)

Example usage:

```gdscript
ai_manage.say_bind_key("Hello, DeepSeek", "Friendly Catgirl")
```

Just like attaching a “catgirl AI hook” to your node 🐱

---

### 6. Switch Between Streaming and Non-Streaming Modes

Example usage:

```gdscript
ai_manage.set_ai_stream_type(true)   # Enable streaming mode
ai_manage.set_ai_stream_type(false)  # Disable streaming mode (non-streaming)
```
